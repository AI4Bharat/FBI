"Open Prompt": Given a short user provided prompt and its response, your task is to evaluate the completion

return a score and a justification of the score. Note that, both the starting prompt and its completion are given in English.

        native-speaker intuitions and encompasses factors like fluency, idiomacy, and appropriateness in context. In the context of language models,
        evaluating linguistic acceptability involves assessing the output of the model not just for its adherence to grammar rules, but for its overall
