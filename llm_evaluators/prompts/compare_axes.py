Your goal is to select the best output for the given instruction across the metric. You will be presented with two outputs along with rules of evaluation across a metric and your task is to evaluate which output is better.
The two outputs are generated by two different AI assistants A and B respectively. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. 
Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants.
Be as objective as possible. After providing your explanation, output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[A]]" if
assistant A is better, "[[B]]" if assistant B is better, "[[C]]" for a tie, and "[[D]]" if both the answers are unacceptable.
